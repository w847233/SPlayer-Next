## Development

### Requirements

- **Node.js** >= 22
- **pnpm** >= 10
- **Rust toolchain** (required to build the native modules; see below)

### Native Modules

Core performance features are powered by Rust-based native modules:

| Module          | Description                                                                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `audio-engine`  | High-performance audio decoding (FFmpeg), playback, FFT spectrum, cover extraction |
| `media-ctrl`    | System media controls + Discord Rich Presence                                      |
| `taskbar-lyric` | Native Windows taskbar lyric rendering                                             |

`pnpm dev` and `pnpm build` compile the native modules automatically. To skip them (e.g. when working only on the UI), set `SKIP_NATIVE_BUILD=true`.

### Getting Started

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 2. Start the dev app (builds native modules in debug, then launches Electron)
pnpm dev
```

### Building

```bash
pnpm build         # Full build: clean → native → typecheck → electron-vite

pnpm build:win     # Package for Windows
pnpm build:mac     # Package for macOS
pnpm build:linux   # Package for Linux (AppImage / deb / rpm / tar.gz / pacman)
```

> By default a build targets the current architecture only. Cross-compilation is not supported.

### Other Scripts

```bash
pnpm typecheck        # tsc + vue-tsc (node + web targets)
pnpm lint             # ESLint
pnpm format           # Prettier
pnpm build:native     # Build the Rust native modules only (add `--dev` for debug)
```
